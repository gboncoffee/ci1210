Introduction to Assembly (RISC-V)

The processor is like a state machine:
- Reads the current instruction;
- Changes the machine's state;
- Repeat.

The state is organized in three parts:
- Memory (RAM): Big (4Gib), slow to access.
- Registers: Small (32 x 4 bytes, 0 is constant), very fast.
- Special PC register: current instruction address.

Operates in bytes (8 bits), halfs (16 bits) and words (32 bits).
Instructions are stored in memory and are a word long.
Load/Store: there's no operation directly in memory!

EGG emulator (version 1.1.3)
- RISC-V IM;
- Good for studying:
  - No pseudoinstructions;
  - Simple and coese syntax without special cases;
  - Direct access to all memory;
- Debugger and IO.

Written in Go, without dependencies.
