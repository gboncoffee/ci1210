Branch and Jump Instructions

Verify a condition and take a jump:
  if (condition) pc += IMM
  else pc += 4

Operate on two registers and an immediate:
beq, bne, blt, bge, bltu, bgeu

Inconditionally jump:
jal ra, imm
jalr ra, rs1, imm

Example: for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
        addi t0, zero, 0
        addi t2, zero, 2
for:
        bge t0, t2, out_for
        addi t0, t0, 1
        jal zero, for
out_for:
